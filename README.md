# Node To-Do App

Notes for CS178 assignment:  
1. Citations: all code was ripped from (this tutorial)[https://medium.com/@diogo.fg.pinheiro/simple-to-do-list-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-chapter-2-3780a1c5b039] and also (this one)[https://medium.com/@diogo.fg.pinheiro/simple-to-do-list-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-chapter-1-c645c7a27583].   
2. More citations: I referenced (this documentation)[https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html] in identifying some concepts.  
3. Even more citations: (this tutorial)[https://dev.to/atultyagi612/build-a-basic-todo-app-with-nodejs-mongodb-20om] was also attempted.  
4. I obviously deleted my user credentials before pushing, so if you want to get this to work, put in your own user credentials.  
5. Thanks to Ziwei Gu for the pointers during Studio.
